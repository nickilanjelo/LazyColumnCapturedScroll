# LazyColumnCapturedScroll

This is a sample project to reproduce bug with the scroll capturing during next page load while obtaining new items for LazyColumn. Scroll captures the list like there is no other items below. The list continues scrolling only after user stops doing scrolling gestures and touches the screen again.
